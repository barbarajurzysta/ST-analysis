## Contents of the repository
* data - gene expression in spots for 3 prostate cancer sections (1.2, 2.4, 3.3) from https://www.spatialresearch.org/resources-published-datasets/10-1038-s41467-018-04724-5/
* SEDR
	* model from [this repository](https://github.com/JinmiaoChenLab/SEDR/)
	* Project.ipynb - notebook with runs of the model and analysis of the results (both of SEDR and other models)
* Seurat - R Markdown scripts for running Seurat and their results
* Poisson - results of Poisson factorization model applied to the data (from Supplementary Data of Berglund, Emelie, et al. "Spatial maps of prostate cancer transcriptomes reveal an unexplored landscape of heterogeneity." Nature communications 9.1 (2018): 1-13.)
